<h1>Welcome to Super Rad</h1>
  <p>There are a few things to share with you today. In fact, these are a few of my favorie things. Let's begin with a litle background
  about super rad experiences I've had (and some other stuff).</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm double jointed. When I was a kid, I used to jump rope with my arms. This means I would pop my arm out of its socket each time I pulled
    the "jump rope" (my arms) over my head.<b> Circus points.</b></li>
    <li>I have two cats which basically makes me an experienced cat whisperer. I whisper to them and nothing happens... but I can tell they understand me.</li>
    <li>In 2015, I co-faciliated a yoga teacher training in prison. It was pretty intense now that I reflect on it. We helped 12 adults in custody (inmates)
    become cerfitied yoga teachers for their peers.</li>
    <li>I'm not sure if I'm doing this assingment correctly. But that means I'm gaining experience trying to figure stuff out. So that's pretty great.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Well, hey there!</p>
