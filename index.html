  <h1>Welcome to Grandmother Trivia</h1>
    <p>Meet Grandmother. She's beautiful, fun, smart, and facetious.
      She enjoys long walks in the park and playing at the beach.
      Her favorite place in the world is Hawaii because she feels she can really let her hair down.
      She also likes France. </p>

      <p>As a lover of trivia, Grandmother designed a little game for you to get to know her.
        She wants to share all the places she's traveled as well as her absolute favorite things with you.
        One could only hope to be so lucky. Look at you, you lucky duck!</p>

        <p>Grandmother currently resides in Oregon.</p>

 <h2>Personal Life</h2>
   <p>Few know much about Grandmother's life prior to NYE 2012, including her. There's a lot that Grandmother
     doesn't remember. Born on May 20, 1900 somewhere in Russia, Grandmother spent most of her time spreading caution about
     communicable diseases and (something).
  <p>In the spring of 1987, Grandmother found herself drinking from a spring after taking a long hike. Nearly five years later, she began
    to notice she hadn't aged a bit. Her skin had not increased in wrinkles, her osteoporosis symptoms began to subside and
    felt quite sprightly overall. She considers that day--the day of the Tuck Everlasting incident--the moment she quit aging. If you ask Grandmother her age,
    she'll give you the same number as she was that fateful day.
   <p>When Grandmother went to Paris in 2013, she got super close to the Mona Lisa.
     In fact, the only photo her family has of the Mona Lisa is of her grinning right in front of it.
     She nearly touched it she was so close. Oh Grandmother... you wily minx.

   <p>While it may be evident, Grandmother has a thing for Jason. She considers him a celebrity.
     She is wildly delighted at the thought of climbing that tree of a man. His blue eyes drive
     Grandmother totally wild.</p>
